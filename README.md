# I-AM-O.S. v12 — Decentralized Sovereign OS

I-AM-O.S. is a local-first, offline-capable operating environment that operates entirely in the browser. It gives you full control over your data, identity, and creations. There are no servers, no accounts, and no permissions asked. Everything you create and interact with is yours forever. 

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity**: Create and manage your own Digital Identity (DID) in-browser with Ed25519 cryptography.
- **IAM-Value**: Earn IAM-Value simply by creating content. The more you create, the more you earn.
- **Local-First**: All files, history, and IAM-Value are stored directly in the browser's `localStorage`. 
- **Immutable Publishing**: Publish your work by generating a permanent CID (Content Identifier).
- **Sovereign Ownership**: You are the sole admin and owner. No one can censor, monetize, or take away what you've created.
- **Voucher System**: Offline redeemable vouchers allow you to gift IAM-Value to others.
- **Genesis Identity**: The first identity (Genesis) has special rights, such as publishing content to the public namespace.
- **Zero-Trust**: No external servers, no internet required to create and manage your files. The OS operates entirely offline.

## Core Principles

1. **You Own Everything**: Everything you create is stored locally and is 100% yours.
2. **No Servers**: Runs entirely in the browser with no need for external servers.
3. **Private Key Security**: Your private key never leaves your device.
4. **Earning IAM-Value**: You earn IAM-Value by typing (mining) in the code editor.
5. **Genesis Rights**: The Genesis identity has 5-year sovereign rights, renewable by the user.
6. **Immutable Publishing**: Once published, content is stored with an immutable CID (currently local, but ready for IPFS integration).
7. **Exportable**: Your entire identity, history, and value are stored in a single HTML file. Copy it anywhere, and you take your OS with you.

## How It Works

- **Identity**: Generate your Ed25519 keypair in-browser to create a permanent DID.
- **File Storage**: All files, balance, vouchers, and history are stored in a local "blockchain" in the browser.
- **Mining**: Simply by typing code, you earn IAM-Value. This is a local proof-of-creation mechanism.
- **Genesis Publishing**: Only the Genesis identity can publish content to the public namespace.
- **Offline Vouchers**: Create and redeem vouchers offline, turning IAM-Value into a giftable asset.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. You immediately become the sovereign owner of the system.
3. Start typing in the editor to begin earning IAM-Value.
4. Create new files by clicking the "+ File" button.
5. Switch to "Live" mode to see a live preview of your work.
6. Click "Publish" to create a permanent CID (Only Genesis identity can publish).
7. Create Vouchers: Convert 100 IAM-Value into an offline redeemable voucher.
8. Save and export your file as it contains everything you need: your identity, value, and apps.

## Key Files and Components

### HTML Interface

- **Header**: Displays the current version (I-AM-O.S. v12) and your IAM-Value balance.
- **Left Panel**: Displays your Sovereign License (DID, token ID), file tree, and file management controls.
- **Center Panel**: The code editor where you can create and edit your files. Switch between Code and Live (Preview) modes.
- **Right Panel**: Displays your Decentralized Dashboard, IAM-Value balance, and options to create and redeem vouchers.
- **Footer**: Provides the footer with the I-AM-O.S. branding and disclaimers.

### Features

- **Code Editor**: The editor allows you to write code in real-time, earning IAM-Value for every keystroke.
- **Live Preview**: Switch between "Code" and "Live" modes to view your file's content.
- **File Management**: Create new files, save, publish, and manage your digital content with the file tree.
- **Sovereign License**: Manage your decentralized identity (DID) and token ID, ensuring your ownership.
- **Voucher System**: Create redeemable vouchers for transferring IAM-Value offline.

## IAM-Value

IAM-Value is the currency of I-AM-O.S. You earn IAM-Value by creating content, saving your work, and publishing files. The Genesis identity has special privileges such as publishing to the public namespace.

## Whitepaper

The **I-AM-O.S. v12 Whitepaper** explains the philosophical and technical aspects of this decentralized, self-sovereign OS.

To access the Whitepaper, click the "Read Whitepaper" button in the right panel.

## Export Your Identity & Files

I-AM-O.S. is designed to be fully portable. To export your entire OS and identity, simply copy the `index.html` file to another device. This file contains:

- Your identity (DID and private key).
- Your files and IAM-Value balance.
- Your vouchers, history, and proposals.
  
This means you can take your entire system, apps, and assets with you wherever you go.

## License

I-AM-O.S. is licensed under the **Sovereign License**. You own everything you create, and the software is designed to be fully local-first with no cloud dependency.
